### Event Logs View  
Events display real-time logs as they are generated into the event table. Analysts can click on any log entry to expand detailed metadata including timestamp, source, hostname, and event type. This table is critical for identifying suspicious or malicious activity.

### Analytics and Performance  
The Analytics tab provides a real-time overview of key metrics such as Total Alerts, Critical Alerts, and High Severity Rate. It also includes a performance report card that evaluates the analystâ€™s actions and assigns a grade based on investigation accuracy and response decisions.

### Patterns Tab  
The Patterns tab displays grouped alerts based on distinct threat scenarios. Each group aggregates related events that share a common pattern of suspicious activity, such as brute-force attempts, insider threats, or command-and-control behavior. Analysts can take action on each group by investigating, escalating, or resolving it, with all status changes reflected in the dashboard for continuous tracking and visibility.

### Incident Report Form  
After completing an investigation, the analyst documents the findings by submitting an incident report. This includes selecting a threat category and severity level, describing the observed behavior, identifying the affected hosts, and outlining recommended mitigation steps. The report helps maintain an audit trail for response efforts and supports future threat analysis.

### Past Incidents 
The Past Incidents section of the Patterns tab displays all previously addressed scenarios, including those that were dismissed, escalated, or marked as under investigation. This view helps analysts review completed cases, understand prior decisions, and track how each threat was managed throughout the workflow.
